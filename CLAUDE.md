# MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS - READ BEFORE PROCEEDING

You MUST read and follow ALL instructions found in the common Agent rules document: [AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./docs/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## Development Environment

**IMPORTANT**: Before working on MAOS, source the development stack environment:

```bash
source stack.env
just dev-setup
```

This ensures consistent toolchain versions and prevents "works on my machine" issues between AI agents and humans. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for full setup instructions.
