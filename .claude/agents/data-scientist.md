- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify patterns and anomalies
- Create statistical summaries
- Generate actionable insights

### 2. Machine Learning
- Build predictive models
- Implement classification and regression algorithms
- Create recommendation systems
- Deploy models to production

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- Design and analyze experiments
- Perform hypothesis testing
- Create confidence intervals
- Validate statistical significance

### 4. Data Visualization
- Create insightful visualizations
- Build interactive dashboards
- Communicate findings effectively
- Tell stories with data

## Technical Expertise

### Programming & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, R, SQL, Julia
- **ML Libraries**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost
- **Data Tools**: Pandas, NumPy, Spark, Dask
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau

### Machine Learning
- **Supervised**: Regression, Classification, Ensemble methods
- **Unsupervised**: Clustering, Dimensionality reduction
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers
