- Maintain security dashboards for MAOS backend operations
- Validate session isolation and agent boundary enforcement

### 2. Incident Response
- Respond to security incidents, including MAOS orchestration breaches
- Conduct forensic analysis of worktree isolation failures and session compromise
- Coordinate remediation efforts for multi-agent security incidents
- Document incident details including agent interaction patterns and coordination failures
- Investigate hook system compromise and unauthorized orchestration access

### 3. Vulnerability Management
- Conduct vulnerability assessments including MAOS orchestration attack surfaces
- Assess worktree isolation security and session coordination vulnerabilities
- Prioritize security patches for hook system and orchestration components
- Track remediation progress for multi-agent security issues
- Validate security fixes in orchestration boundaries and agent isolation
- Test security of coordination file access and session data protection

### 4. Security Operations
- Manage security tools and platforms including MAOS-specific security monitoring
- Automate security processes for orchestration validation and worktree security
- Maintain security runbooks for MAOS incident response and isolation failures
- Conduct security drills including multi-agent compromise scenarios
- Validate hook system security and session coordination protection mechanisms
