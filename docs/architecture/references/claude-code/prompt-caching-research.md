Here's a comprehensive overview of Claude's prompt caching feature:

Key Technical Details:
- Allows caching specific prompt prefixes to reduce processing time and API costs
- Supports up to 4 cache breakpoints in a single request
- Default cache lifetime is 5 minutes, with an optional 1-hour cache available
- Caches can include tools, system instructions, context, and conversation history

Implementation Mechanics:
- Uses `cache_control` parameter to mark cacheable sections
- Caches are created in hierarchy: tools → system → messages
- Minimum cacheable prompt length varies by model (1024-2048 tokens)

Supported Models:
- Claude Opus 4
- Claude Sonnet 4
- Claude Sonnet 3.7
- Claude Sonnet 3.5
- Claude Haiku 3.5
- Claude Haiku 3
- Claude Opus 3

Pricing Structure:
- Cache writes cost 25% more than base input tokens
- Cache hits cost only 10% of base input token price
- Pricing varies by model

Cache Invalidation Triggers:
- Modifying tool definitions
- Changing system instructions
- Adding/removing images
- Altering tool use settings

Best Use Cases:
- RAG applications with large document contexts
- Agent systems using multiple tools
- Long-running conversations
- Scenarios requiring consistent context across multiple interactions

Unique Features:
- Organization-specific cache isolation
- Automatic cache refresh on usage
- Supports caching of thinking blocks in tool use scenarios

Based on the Anthropic cookbook example, here are key insights on prompt caching:

Key Prompt Caching Strategies:
1. Performance Optimization
- Reduces latency by over 2x
- Can decrease costs up to 90%
- Enables storing and reusing context within prompts

Implementation Techniques:
- Use `cache_control`: {"type": "ephemeral"} to enable caching
- Add beta header "prompt-caching-2024-07-31"
- Incrementally cache conversation turns

Multi-Turn Conversation Optimization:
- Cache system messages containing large context (like book content)
- Progressively cache user and assistant turns
- Aim to cache >90% of input tokens in subsequent interactions

Performance Metrics Example:
- Initial non-cached call: ~20 seconds
- Subsequent cached calls: 6-7 seconds
- Near-instant token retrieval after initial cache setup

Best Practices:
- Include detailed instructions and example responses in cached context
- Use ephemeral caching for dynamic, session-specific content
- Monitor token caching percentages
- Adjust cache breakpoints strategically

The example demonstrates how intelligent caching can dramatically improve AI interaction efficiency and reduce computational overhead.

Here are the key technical details about Anthropic's multi-agent research system:

Architecture Overview:
- Uses an "orchestrator-worker pattern" with a lead agent coordinating specialized subagents
- Subagents operate in parallel, exploring different aspects of a research query simultaneously
- Dynamically creates 3-5 subagents based on query complexity

Key Architectural Principles:
1. Parallel Tool Calling
- Subagents can use 3+ tools in parallel
- Cuts research time by up to 90% for complex queries
- Enables exploring multiple research directions concurrently      

2. Prompt Engineering Strategies
- Teach lead agent how to effectively delegate tasks
- Create clear task boundaries for each subagent
- Use "extended thinking mode" as a controllable scratchpad
- Start with broad queries, then progressively narrow focus

Performance Optimization Techniques:
- Token usage explains 80% of performance variance
- Multi-agent systems use ~15x more tokens than standard chat interactions
- Best for tasks requiring:
    - Heavy parallelization
    - Information exceeding single context windows
    - Complex tool interfaces

Evaluation Approach:
- Use LLM-as-judge for scalable output evaluation
- Focus on end-state results rather than prescriptive step-by-step processes
- Start with small sample sets of ~20 representative queries

Challenges:
- Stateful agents make error propagation complex
- Synchronous execution creates potential bottlenecks
- Requires careful deployment and error handling strategies

The system represents a sophisticated approach to scaling AI research capabilities through intelligent agent coordination.

Key Agent Development Principles:
1. Start Simple
- Begin with basic prompts and minimal complexity
- "Only add complexity when it demonstrably improves outcomes"
- Prioritize measuring performance and iterating

Agent Architecture Patterns:
1. Augmented LLM (Basic Building Block)
- Enhanced with retrieval, tools, and memory
- Can generate search queries and select appropriate tools

2. Workflow Types:
- Prompt Chaining: Decompose tasks into sequential steps
- Routing: Classify inputs and direct to specialized tasks
- Parallelization: Run subtasks simultaneously
- Orchestrator-Workers: Central LLM breaks down and delegates tasks
- Evaluator-Optimizer: Generate and refine responses iteratively

3. Autonomous Agents
- Operate independently after initial human instruction
- Gain "ground truth" from environmental feedback
- Require careful tool design and documentation

Performance Considerations:
- Higher complexity means increased latency and cost
- Test extensively in sandboxed environments
- Implement appropriate guardrails
- Use stopping conditions to maintain control

Tool Development Best Practices:
- Design clear, intuitive tool interfaces
- Provide example usage and edge cases
- Minimize formatting "overhead"
- Test extensively to identify potential model mistakes

Recommended Implementation Approach:
- Maintain simplicity
- Ensure transparency in agent's planning
- Carefully document and test agent-computer interfaces

Here's a detailed breakdown of Claude model pricing, focusing on prompt caching:

- Input: $3 per Million Tokens
- Output: $15 per Million Tokens
- Prompt Caching:
    - Write: $3.75 per Million Tokens
    - Read: $0.30 per Million Tokens

Claude Haiku 3.5:
- Input: $0.80 per Million Tokens
- Output: $4 per Million Tokens
- Prompt Caching:
    - Write: $1 per Million Tokens
    - Read: $0.08 per Million Tokens

Optimization Strategy:
- Batch processing can save up to 50% on costs
- Prompt caching pricing reflects a 5-minute Time-To-Live (TTL)
