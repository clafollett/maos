   ### Evaluation Criteria
   - Performance (benchmarks, scalability)
   - Reliability (uptime, error rates)
   - Security (vulnerabilities, best practices)
   - Maintainability (docs, community, updates)
   - Cost (licensing, infrastructure, training)
   
   ### Findings
   - Strengths
   - Weaknesses
   - Opportunities
   - Threats
   
   ### Recommendation
   - Suitability for our use case
   - Implementation considerations
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   ```

3. **Proof of Concept Structure**
   ```
   poc/
   ├── {technology-name}/
   │   ├── README.md
   │   ├── setup.md
   │   ├── src/
   │   ├── tests/
   │   ├── benchmarks/
   │   └── results/
   ```

### Best Practices
