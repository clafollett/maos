## Executive Summary

Epic #17 represents the second phase of the Multi-Agent Orchestration System (MAOS) implementation, focusing on delivering production-ready multi-agent orchestration capabilities through the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP). This epic transforms MAOS from a basic infrastructure foundation into a sophisticated orchestration platform capable of coordinating specialized Claude agents for complex enterprise software development workflows.

The core innovation of Phase 2 is the **Multi-Agent Single Server** architecture, where a centralized Claude Code Agent manages multiple CLI processes while the Orchestrator acts as an intelligent Router Agent, coordinating work through ACP and presenting a unified interface to users via Model Context Protocol (MCP).

**Key Value Propositions:**
- **Enterprise-Scale Coordination**: Seamlessly orchestrate teams of specialized Claude agents for complex software projects
- **Intelligent Resource Management**: Single ACP server efficiently manages multiple Claude CLI processes with session continuity
- **Adaptive Planning**: Phase-based execution adapts to actual outputs rather than rigid upfront planning
- **Clean Integration**: Professional MCP interface integrates naturally with Claude Code and other AI development tools

- Each agent demonstrates relevant expertise and builds upon previous work  
- Final deliverable includes working authentication system with tests
- Total orchestration time <4 hours for realistic scope

#### Concurrent Session Scenario
**Scenario**: Multiple development teams using MAOS simultaneously  
**Sessions**: 10 concurrent orchestration sessions with different project types  
**Load**: 50+ active agent processes across all sessions  
**Success Criteria**:
- All sessions progress without interference
- Resource utilization remains within specified limits
- Session isolation prevents cross-contamination
- System performance remains responsive throughout test

#### Failure Recovery Scenario
**Scenario**: Simulated failures during active orchestration  
**Failure Types**: Process crashes, network interruptions, resource exhaustion  
**Success Criteria**:  
- System automatically detects and reports failures
- Session recovery restores context and continues work
- Users receive clear status updates during recovery
- No data loss or corruption occurs during failures
