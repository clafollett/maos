# MAOS Implementation Roadmap: Revolutionary ACP Architecture

*This document outlines the major implementation epics for building the world's first **Orchestrator-as-Interface + ACP Network** Multi-Agent Orchestration System (MAOS) based on our revolutionary architectural breakthroughs.*

## üöÄ Revolutionary Architecture Overview

MAOS represents a **paradigm shift** in multi-agent systems through:

```
Claude Code ‚Üî MCP Server ‚Üî Orchestrator (SINGLE INTERFACE)
                              ‚Üï ACP Network  
                          Specialist Agents (PURE ACP)
```

**üéØ Key Breakthroughs:**
- **Perfect Context Continuity**: Agents never lose memory via Claude Code session binding (revolutionary!)
- **Intelligent Agent Pool Management**: Sleep/reactivate agents while preserving full context
- **Maximum Focus & Productivity**: Agents work in isolation without interruptions (proven efficient)
- **Minimal Communication**: ACP used only for essential coordination, not chatter
- **Orchestrator-as-Interface**: Single point of interaction with Claude Code
- **Pure ACP Network**: All agents communicate via standardized Agent Communication Protocol  
- **Hidden Complexity**: Users see unified progress, not agent coordination chaos
- **Dual Lifecycle Support**: Both micro-task (high-efficiency) and phase-based patterns
- **Eliminated Bottlenecks**: No central message routing or broken tools

The implementation is organized into **5 major epics**, each building toward the complete ACP-based orchestration system.
