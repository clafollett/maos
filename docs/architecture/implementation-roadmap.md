# MAOS Implementation Roadmap: PTY Multiplexer Architecture

*This document outlines the major implementation epics for building the **Orchestrator-as-PTY-Multiplexer** Multi-Agent Orchestration System (MAOS) based on our architectural innovations.*

## üöÄ Architecture Overview

MAOS represents a **paradigm shift** in multi-agent systems through:

```
Claude Code ‚Üî MCP Server ‚Üî Orchestrator (PTY MULTIPLEXER)
                              ‚Üï PTY Control  
                          Specialist Agents (Claude CLI)
```

**üéØ Key Breakthroughs:**
- **Perfect Context Continuity**: Agents never lose memory via Claude CLI session binding
- **Intelligent Agent Pool Management**: Sleep/reactivate agents while preserving full context
- **Maximum Focus & Productivity**: Agents work in isolation without interruptions (proven efficient)
- **Minimal Communication**: PTY used only for essential coordination, not chatter
- **Orchestrator-as-PTY-Multiplexer**: Single point of interaction with Claude Code
- **Pure PTY Control**: All agents managed via direct process control  
- **Configurable Transparency**: Users can choose unified progress view or visible agent terminals
- **Dual Lifecycle Support**: Both micro-task (high-efficiency) and phase-based patterns
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux via portable-pty
- **No Network Dependencies**: Eliminated port management and network complexity

The implementation is organized into **5 major epics**, each building toward the complete PTY multiplexer orchestration system.
