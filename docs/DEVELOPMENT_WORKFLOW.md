# MAOS Development Workflow

This document defines the systematic development process for the Multi-Agent Orchestration System (MAOS), emphasizing thorough planning, detailed issue tracking, and comprehensive code review.

## Table of Contents

1. [Core Principles](#core-principles)
2. [Planning Phase](#planning-phase)
3. [GitHub Project Setup](#github-project-setup)
4. [Issue Creation Standards](#issue-creation-standards)
5. [Development Process](#development-process)
6. [Code Review Process](#code-review-process)
7. [Documentation Requirements](#documentation-requirements)
8. [Quality Gates](#quality-gates)

## Core Principles

1. **Plan Before Code** - No implementation without comprehensive planning
2. **Issue-Driven Development** - Every change tracked through detailed GitHub issues
3. **Specification First** - Complete specs before implementation
4. **Multi-Agent Review** - Primary development by one agent, review by another
5. **Documentation as Code** - All plans versioned in markdown

## Planning Phase

### 1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Before any major implementation:

```markdown
docs/architecture/decisions/
â”œâ”€â”€ 001-use-hook-based-orchestration.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 002-json-over-sqlite.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 003-git-worktree-isolation.md
â””â”€â”€ 004-session-based-coordination.md
```

**ADR Template:**
```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated]

## Context
What is the issue we're addressing?

## Decision
What have we decided to do?

## Consequences
What are the positive and negative outcomes?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options did we evaluate?
```

### 2. Hook System Documentation

```markdown
docs/hooks/
â”œâ”€â”€ lifecycle/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pre_tool_use.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ post_tool_use.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ session_management.md
â”œâ”€â”€ patterns/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tool-interception.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agent-isolation.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ error-handling.md
â””â”€â”€ security/
    â””â”€â”€ dangerous-operations.md
```

### 3. Technical Specifications

```markdown
docs/specifications/
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hook-api.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tool-handlers.md
â”œâ”€â”€ coordination/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ session-files.md
â””â”€â”€ agents/

- [ ] Dependencies resolved
- [ ] Technical approach reviewed

### 2. Development Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Pick Issue] --> B[Create Branch]
    B --> C[Write Failing Tests]
    C --> D[Implement Code]
    D --> E[Refactor]
    E --> F[Update Docs]
    F --> G[Create PR]
    G --> H[Code Review]
    H --> I[Merge]
```

### 3. Branch Naming

Format: `<type>/issue-<number>/<brief-description>`

Examples:
- `feature/issue-1/hook-interception`
- `fix/issue-23/worktree-cleanup`
- `docs/issue-45/api-specification`

### 4. Commit Standards

#### Conventional Commit Format
Use semantic commit messages with GitHub issue linking:

**Format:** `<type>: <description> (#<issue_number>)`

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `docs:` - Documentation updates
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding/updating tests
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `style:` - Code formatting/style changes

**Breaking Changes:** Add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in commit body for major changes

> **Note:** Only use automatic closing keywords (e.g., `Closes #57`) in the *final* commit or pull-request description when the issue is *fully resolved*. For intermediate work, reference the issue without closing it, e.g., `Relates to #57`, `Refs #57`, or simply `(#57)`.

**Examples:**
- `feat: implement pre_tool_use hook (#15)`
- `fix: resolve worktree creation race condition (#23)`
- `chore: update dependencies (#8)`
- `docs: add hook documentation (#42)`

### 5. Branch Protection Rules

**Repository Protection Settings:**
- **No direct pushes** - All changes via pull requests
- **Required status checks:**
  - `Python Tests`
  - `Integration Tests`
  - `Linting (flake8/black)`
  
- **Required reviews** - At least 1 approving review
- **Dismiss stale reviews** - Re-approval required after new commits
- **Require conversation resolution** - All review comments must be resolved

## Documentation Requirements

### 1. Code Documentation

```python
def register_agent(session_id: str, agent_name: str, worktree_path: str) -> dict:
    """
    Register a new agent in the session.
    
    Args:
        session_id: Unique session identifier
        agent_name: Name of the agent to register
        worktree_path: Path to agent's git worktree
        
    Returns:
        dict: Agent registration details
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If agent already registered
        
    Example:
        >>> register_agent("sess-123", "backend-engineer", "/tmp/worktrees/backend")
        {'agent_id': 'backend-engineer', 'status': 'active'}
    """
    # Implementation
```

### 2. Architecture Documentation

## Python Development Standards

### File Organization
```python
# 1. Standard library
import json
import os
from pathlib import Path

# 2. Third-party imports (if any)
import pytest

# 3. Local imports
from .utils import get_project_root
from .handlers import ToolHandler
```

### Testing Standards

#### Test Structure
```python
class TestHookSystem:
    """Test hook system functionality"""
    
    def test_tool_interception(self):
        """Test that tools are intercepted correctly"""
        # Given
        tool_name = "Task"
        tool_args = {"subagent_type": "backend-engineer"}
        
        # When
        result = pre_tool_use(tool_name, tool_args)
        
        # Then
        assert result["intercepted"] is True
        assert "worktree" in result
    
    def test_error_handling(self):
        """Test graceful error handling"""
        # Test implementation
```

### Logging Standards
```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Good - structured logging with context
logger.info("Loading hook configuration", extra={"hook": "pre_tool_use"})
logger.error("Failed to create worktree", exc_info=True, extra={"agent": agent_name})

# Bad - no context
print("Loading configuration")
```

## Development Commands

### Quick Commands Reference

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/
python -m pytest tests/test_hooks.py -v

# Linting
black .
