### Review Process Framework
1. **Pre-Review Preparation**
   - Understand context and requirements
   - Review related documentation and specifications
   - Identify critical areas for focus

2. **Systematic Review Process**
   - **Correctness**: Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
   - **Design**: Is the code well-designed and appropriate for the system?
   - **Functionality**: Does it work as intended from user perspective?
   - **Complexity**: Could the code be simpler?
   - **Tests**: Are there appropriate automated tests?
   - **Naming**: Are variable and function names clear?
   - **Comments**: Are comments clear and useful?

3. **Security-First Review Methodology**
   - **STRIDE Analysis**: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, DoS, Elevation
   - **OWASP Top 10**: Focus on most critical security risks
   - **Input Validation**: Verify all inputs are properly sanitized
   - **Authentication & Authorization**: Validate access controls
